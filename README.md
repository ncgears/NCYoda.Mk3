# NCYoda.Mk2

Adaptation of our 2019-20 Infinite Recharge robot (swerve) code into Java.  This has been developed from that ground up to be a re-usable framework to support robots for many years going forward.

We encourage you to learn from our code, which we will be continually updating and improving. 

If you would like to know something specific about our code, reach out to us.  Our lead programming mentor can be reached here: jim at ncgears.com

Thanks!
